# Repositório de Métodos numéricos
### André Brandão

The present repository aims to serve as a place to hold all the fortran codes i write during the discipline of Numerical Methods in mechanical sciences.
Below it's explained how it's organized with the explanation of each code presented in the [code folder](./codes).

Along with the codes, in the [Analysis](./Analysis) folder is the pdf files with some analysis made with every code developed.

## Code 1 - 4th order Runge kutta method

A sphere sedimenting in a fluid is studied here. This method is applied to the second law of Newton:

$$
    m_p \frac{dv_z}{dt}=-6\pi\eta av_z-\frac{9}{4}\pi\rho_ra^2v_z^2+\frac{4}{3}\pi a^3\Delta\rho g
$$
